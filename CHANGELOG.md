    ```sql
    INSERT INTO badge_completions (id, user_id, badge_id, completion_date, pending)
    SELECT id, user_id, badge_id, claimed_date, 1
    FROM claimed_badges;
    
    INSERT INTO badge_completions (id, user_id, badge_id, completion_date, pending)
    SELECT id, user_id, badge_id, unlocked_date, 0
    FROM unlocked_badges;
    ```
